## About

👋 Hi, I’m **Felipe Muñoz** — cloud solutions architect and technology leader with **11+ years of experience** designing, migrating, and operating mission-critical platforms on **Google Cloud** for public and private sectors across Latin America.

I’ve led **large-scale infrastructure migrations**, built **data and AI platforms**, and I’m currently building **byCerebro**, a SaaS platform for **AI agent orchestration** focused on automating real, high-impact business processes.

---

## What I believe in

- Cloud is not infrastructure — it’s **execution capability**
- AI is not a model — it’s a **living system**
- Architecture should serve the business, not the other way around
- Automation is a **competitive advantage**, not a luxury

---

## What I build

- Secure, scalable **cloud-native platforms**
- **Production-grade AI systems** (not demos)
- **Multi-agent** and event-driven architectures
- Infrastructure as Code ready for real-world operations
- Solutions for **government, banking, retail, and healthcare**

---

## Featured Project: byCerebro

- **AI agent orchestration**
- End-to-end business process automation
- Seamless integration with cloud ecosystems and enterprise APIs

Built on:

- Google Cloud Agent Development Kit (ADK)
- Vertex AI Agent Engine
- Secure, scalable, multi-tenant architecture

> From innovation award–winning prototype to a growing commercial product.

## Local development & deploy (GitHub Pages)

This repository is intended to back a GitHub Pages site. The exact local setup depends on the stack you choose:

- **Static HTML/CSS/JS**: add an `index.html` at the repo root and open it, or serve locally:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 5173
```

- **Jekyll** (native GitHub Pages): add a `_config.yml` and run locally:

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

- **Node build** (Astro/Vite/Next/etc.): add a `package.json` and run the project scripts (e.g. `npm run dev`). Deploy typically goes via **GitHub Actions**.
